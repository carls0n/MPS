* New! [ January 17, 2025 ] Consume mode is now default. Tracks will be removed from the playlist as they are played.
Also, showlist now shows remaining tracks left in playlist. Playtime now shows remaining tracks and remaining time left in playlist

* [ January 19 2025 ] - Disabled turn on/off eq on the fly. Eq started at playtime makes for much smoother song changes than the previous method of turning eq on/off during playback. EQ can still be enabled at playtime.
* [ January 22, 2025 ] - So, I decided to completely get rid of consume mode. I don't like it. The playtime function still shows remaining time left in playlist.
* --> New! Introducing the new queued function which shows you the next song in the queue. Great when using shuffle. shuf has replaced the native mplayer shuffle function, so you will need to install it if you don't have it already installed.
